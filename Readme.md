# Paytm website Clone

- This is a Paytm website clone made using tailwind css


## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS custom properties


## What I learned
- I learned how to arrange components with tailwind css.
- I now have a strong understanding of tailwind CSS classes after completing this Project. Tailwind CSS makes life much easier.

## Time taken
- It took me around `` six and half hours `` Since this was my first tailwind project, I relied on the tailwind CSS docs to find classes, which took some time.
